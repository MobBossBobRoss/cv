    Prisons are facilities meant to hold dangerous and disruptive people
    for the purposes of protecting others, punishing the disruptive elements,
    and ultimately reforming them into productive members of society.

    Unfortunately in the United States, the majority of prisons and the people
    that run them are profit motivated. This means that they put their bottom
    line over the reformation of their inmates. They cut corners in any way they
    can get away with, especially on reformative programs. This is because they
    get most of their money from government grants which encourage them to stay
    as full as possible, for as long as possible.

    Many prisons also make large amounts of money through forced prison labor.
    This is a legal form of modern slavery, where prisoners are made to manufacture
    things like textiles in sweatshop conditions, among other forms of labor. They
    do this for almost-non-existant wages, under threat of punishment such as
    sentence extension, rejection of parole, and indefinite solitary confinement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite numerous strikes against this forced labor, its minimal pay, and terrible conditions,
    things have barely changed for the better. Those who participate in and organize these strikes
    often face severe punishments, of questionable legality.

  <p>
    U.S. courts have repeatedly ruled that convicts are not protected by the constitutional
   prohibition against involuntary servitude.
