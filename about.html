      Hi there. I am the founder and Prophet of the Ascetic Truth, Hugh Mann.
      Believe it or not, I was once like you. Every day I struggled under the pressure
      of endless stress in my life. My financial troubles held me under the water,
      and more than once I wanted to give up.
    </p>

    <p>
      But just when things were at their darkest, I received a vision. A vision
      of a family of truly free people, their shackles cast off to me. I had persuaded
      them to free themselves, and in turn they had freed me. Together we worshipped
      God in such revelry, as if he were right there dancing with us.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this inspiration I founded the Ascetic Truth. I taught others to let go
      of their smartphones, their gold jewelery, even their money. These were a
      toxic influence, causing their bearers to think only of them and not of the
      glory of God. And through the blessing of God I found that as each new member's
      burden lessened, so did mine. My financial worries dissolved like they were never
      there. Hallelujah!
    </p>
